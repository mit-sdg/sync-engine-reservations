# Reservations — assembled read-back

_Assembled by sync-engine from registered concepts and composition. Edit the concept_
_specifications and composition source, then regenerate this file._

## Concepts

### Reserving

Defined in [Reserving](../design/concepts/Reserving.md), line 1.

#### Actions

- `reserve(user: User, resource: Resource) : return (reservation: Reservation)`
  - Refuses `ALREADY_RESERVED`: That resource is already reserved.
- `cancel(reservation: Reservation) : return (reservation: Reservation)`
  - Refuses `NO_SUCH_RESERVATION`: There is no such reservation.

#### Queries

- `_all() : many (reservation: Reservation, user: User, resource: Resource)`

#### Instances

- `Reserving` — instance of `Reserving` — [Application types](../design/types.md), line 14.
  - `Resource` is `Table` — [Application types](../design/types.md), line 16.
  - `User` is `Name` — [Application types](../design/types.md), line 15.

## Application types

Concrete types:

- `Name` — [Application types](../design/types.md), line 6.
- `Table` — [Application types](../design/types.md), line 9.

## Formers

_Formers name result shapes evaluated when asked. The source former owns_
_the authored explanation; this section records the generated shape._

### the reservation book

Authored path: `Reservations.ReservationBook`.

        reservation
        resource
        user

### Reservations.Reserve#2

## Endpoint input contracts

Before recording an action ask, the boundary rejects a body that is not an
object or lacks a required key. The response uses `INVALID_INPUT` and names
the path or missing key. A declared default fills an absent key. Endpoints
not listed here have no explicit input contract.

- `/reservations/cancel` — requires `reservation`
- `/reservations/reserve` — requires `user`, `resource`
